# Summary
##[ Outlier Detection | Z-Score Method ](https://github.com/SangamSilwal/Machine-learning-Series/blob/main/class_9_A.ipynb)
###Here I learned about Z-Score Method for removing outlier in the dataset
There are 2 approach 
1. Trimming: We just remove the row conatinaing the outlier
2. Clapping: We replaced the lower outlier by lower maximum data and upper outlier by upper maximum data
The formula for calculating lower and upper data is --> mean - 3SD \ mean + 3SD
